# Air Fare Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project implements a **machine learning–based air fare price prediction system**.  
The model analyzes historical flight data and predicts the **ticket price** based on various input features, helping users estimate airfare costs in advance.

## Project Overview

- **Type:** Regression  
- **Domain:** Data Science / Machine Learning  
- **Framework:** Python (Scikit-learn)  
- **Execution Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

The project focuses on feature engineering and supervised learning to achieve accurate fare predictions.

## Model Details

- Uses **regression-based machine learning models**
- Trained on historical flight fare data
- Considers multiple features such as airline, source, destination, duration, and stops
- Outputs the **predicted flight fare**

## Workflow

**Data Collection → Data Cleaning → Feature Encoding → Model Training → Fare Prediction**


## Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn
